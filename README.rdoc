== Yelp Clone

This is a Rails project I made to gain some experience with the framework. It has a few things that I learned newly for this project:

* Scaffolding in Rails

* Using Bootstrap for fast front-end user experience

* More extensive modeling and validations

* Callbacks in Rails models

* The Rails CRUD interface
